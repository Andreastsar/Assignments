      <p>
            The <code>let</code> keyword for declaring variables was introduced in Javascript ES6. Variables declared
            inside curly braces ({ }) with 'let' can have block scope and cannot be accessed from outside this block.
            As we already mentioned varables declared with the <code>var</code> keyword can not have block scope, thus
            they can be accessed from outside the block. Redeclaring a variable using <code>var</code> can lead to
            problems
            because if the variable is inside a block, the variable will be redeclared and outside of this block. We can
            solve
            this problem using the <code>let</code> keyword.
      </p>
      <h2>The <code>const</code> Keyword</h2>
      <p>
            Variables defined with <code>const</code> cannot be redeclared and reassigned. They also have block scope.
            JavaScript <code>const</code> variables must be assigned a value when they are declared. As a general rule,
            always declare variables with <code>const</code> unless you know that the value will change.
      </p>
      <p>We very often use <code>const</code> when we want to declare:</p>
      <p>
      <ul>
            <li>A new Array</li>
            <li>A new Object</li>
            <li>A new Function</li>
            <li>A new RegExp</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p><em>NOTE:The keyword <code>const</code> does not exactly defines a constant value, but a constant reference
                  to a value. As a result we can change a constant array and an object defined with <code>const</code>.
                  However we cannot reassigned the array.
                  </code></em></p>
