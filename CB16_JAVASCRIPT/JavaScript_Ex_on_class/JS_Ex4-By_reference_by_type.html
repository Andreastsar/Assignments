      <h1>Ex 4 - Primitive & By Reference Data Types v1</h1>
      <p>In JavaScript there are six primitive data types: Number, Primitive,
            Boolean, Null, Symbol and Undefined. They are called <em>Primitive</em>
            because they cannot be reduced in more fundamental building blocks.
      </p>
      <p>The <em>Reference</em> data types are composite types because they
            can contain both primitive and other composite types. Composite types
            build on a fundamental building-block type in JavaScript called
            <em>Object</em>, a flexible collection of diverse types with any
            number of different members.
      </p>
      <p>The basic data types fall into 2 groups based on the way they store
            their information:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>Primitive Types - Their value is stored directly into a
                  memory location assigned for that identifier.</li>
            <li>Reference Types - A Reference to a memory location containing
                  the data for the object is assigned to the identifier.</li>
      </ul>
