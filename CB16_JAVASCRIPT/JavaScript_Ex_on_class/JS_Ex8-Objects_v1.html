      <p>
            In Javascript an Object is a container of properties, where a property has a name and a value.
            In JavaScript, arrays is a special kind of object, functions are objects, regular expressions
            are objects and, of course, objects are objects.
      </p>
      <p>
            At their core objects are containers storing related data and functionality. Objects in JaObjects can
            contain other objects so they can easily represent more complex data structures like trees and graphs.
      </p>
      <h2>Object Literals</h2>
      <p>
            It is the simplest way to create an object. An object literal can be created as a pair of curly braces ({ })
            containing zero or more name/value pairs. A value in an object can be updated directly by assignment. If the
            property name is already there, the value of the property is replaced with the new one.
